# RecurseCracklePop-in-Python
Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.


    for i in range(1, 101):

        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print "Crackle PoP!"

        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print "Crackle..."

        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print "PoP!"

        else:
            print i
